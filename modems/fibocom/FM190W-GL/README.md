## Firmware Flashing Process 
Make sure you have downloaded and installed all software and drivers from requirements section above. 

 - Plug modem into PC via usb and open device manager. If the Fibocom usb drivers have been installed successfully, you should see **”Ports”** populate in your device manager list a few seconds after plugging in the modem. Click on ports to reveal the list of all available modem ports. Make note of the number of your **DM port**. This is the port we are going to use to flash the firmware.
 - Open **Qflash**  software, select the **COM port** number that corresponds with the **DM port** from device manager and set **Baudrate** to 460800.
 - Click **Load FW Files** and navigate to where you have the RM551 firmware update folder saved. 
 - The file you need is located at **update>firehose>**  prog_firehose_sdx7x.elf
 - Click **Start** once the progress bar finishes the modem is now flashed with Quectel firmware.

## NV Restore Process 

 - Make sure Qflash is closed and modem is still plugged in.
 - Open **QPST software**
 - I’m linking this [guide](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/pofi5g7lz3jcelh6howwx/Qpst-Restore-QCN-20191206.pdf?rlkey=myqimvlsh3a54qy0pbau3bhqo&st=uet6w623&dl=0) to help you follow along with the instructions.
 - If the DM port isn’t automatically detected by QPST, select **Add New Port** from the **Ports** tab.
 - Under the **Start Clients** menu, select **Software Download**
 - Select the **Restore** tab, make sure your **DM port** is selected and load in the RM551 **.xqcn** file that you saved.
 - Make sure Allow ESN mismatch is selected and click **Start**
 - Wait until status says **Memory Restore Completed **

## Congratulations you are now the proud owner of an RMFaux51
